Currently, it only knows about temperature devices. That is, any device
with a class 0x10, 0x28, or 0x22. I am open to the idea of adding support
for other OneWire devices on a commercial basis. I might get to adding
them sooner or later, but if you want them sooner and you don't want to do
them yourselves, expect to pay me. Happy to accept patches, of course.
